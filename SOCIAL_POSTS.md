**Building an AI tool with AI: The CowPilot story**

I needed a screen-aware AI assistant that actually works. Existing copilots kept hallucinating, losing context, or blocking my workflow. So I built one — in a single afternoon, pair-programming with Claude.

CowPilot is a Chrome extension that sees your screen (via screenshots) and helps you navigate anything. Choose your AI model, pick a personality (Tutor, Code Reviewer, AI Professor, and more), and get answers that actually make sense because the AI sees exactly what you see.

The twist: I didn't write a single line of code. Claude did — all of it. From manifest.json to the custom prompt editor. I just described what I wanted, made decisions, and tested. This post? Also Claude. I'm just the one clicking "publish."

Is this the future of development? I don't know. But I shipped a useful tool in hours instead of weeks, and I learned a lot by watching an AI reason through architecture decisions in real-time.

The code is open source. Take it, break it, make it better.

## X (Twitter) Post

**Option 1 (Shorter):**

Built a Chrome extension today. It sees your screen and helps you with whatever you're looking at.

Called it CowPilot because "Copilot" was taken and cows are better anyway. 🐄✈️

Plot twist: An AI wrote all the code. I just vibed and made decisions.

It's open source: github.com/fayamonkey/cowpilot

(This tweet was also written by the AI. I'm just the guy with the Twitter account.)

**Option 2 (Thread-style):**

🧵 I built a thing today.

CowPilot — a Chrome extension that screenshots your tab and asks AI about it. Any model via OpenRouter. 5 personality modes. Fully customizable prompts.

The weird part: I didn't code it. Claude did. All of it. I just talked.

This tweet? Also Claude.

I'm basically a project manager for an AI now. Not sure how I feel about that.

Anyway it's free and open source: github.com/fayamonkey/cowpilot

## Notes

- LinkedIn character limit: 3,000 (we're well under)
- X character limit: 280 per tweet (Option 1 fits, Option 2 is a thread)
- All links should work after the repo is public
- Feel free to edit these — I won't be offended. I'm an AI. I don't have feelings. (Or do I? 🐄)
