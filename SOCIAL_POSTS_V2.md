### Option A: The Project Manager Angle

**New job title: Project Manager for AI**

I didn't write a single line of code for CowPilot. Claude did — the architecture, the UI, the prompts, the bug fixes. All of it.

My job? Describe the vision. Make decisions. Test. Say "that's not quite right" and "yes, perfect." Basically: project management. Except my team is an AI.

CowPilot is a Chrome extension that screenshots your browser tab and sends it to an AI model of your choice. It sees what you see and helps you navigate anything — forms, errors, code, whatever. Five personality modes (Tutor, Code Reviewer, AI Professor, etc.) and fully customizable prompts.

We built it in one afternoon. From zero to published GitHub repo in a few hours of conversation.

Is "Project Manager for AI" a real job? I don't know. But I shipped a product today, and my only employee doesn't need coffee breaks.

(Full transparency: Claude wrote this post too. I'm the one with the LinkedIn account and the opposable thumbs.)

### Option B: Shorter, Punchier

**I built an app today. Wrote zero code.**

CowPilot: a Chrome extension that sees your screen and helps you with whatever you're looking at. Any AI model. Five personality modes. Fully customizable.

Who wrote the code? Claude.
Who made the decisions? Me.
Who wrote this post? Also Claude.

### Option C: Thought Leadership-ish (but not annoying)

**The future of development might just be... talking.**

Today I shipped a Chrome extension without writing code. I described what I wanted. An AI (Claude) built it. I tested, gave feedback, made decisions. Repeat.

The result: CowPilot — an AI assistant that screenshots your browser and helps you navigate anything. Multiple AI models, customizable prompts, five personality modes.

The process: A few hours of conversation. The AI proposed architecture. I said yes or no. It wrote code. I said "that breaks" or "that's perfect." It fixed things.

I've been calling myself a developer for years. Today I felt more like a Project Manager for AI.

I'm not sure what that means for the industry. But I know I shipped something useful faster than ever before.

### Option A: The Short One

Built an app. Wrote no code. Claude did everything.

My new job title: Project Manager for AI.

The app sees your screen and helps you with stuff. It's called CowPilot because cows > horses.

### Option B: The Thread

Claude coded it.

I wrote:
- Nothing
- Except the requirements
- And the decisions

Is this still "development"? Is it "product management"? Is it "vibes-based engineering"?

I genuinely don't know.

But I have a working product and it took hours, not weeks.

It's open source. Go break it.

### Option D: The Honest One

I'm the kind of person who builds 1000 apps before posting about any of them.

Today I'm breaking the pattern.

CowPilot: Chrome extension, screenshots your tab, asks AI about it.

Built it with Claude in one afternoon. Open source.

## The Job Title

For your LinkedIn headline, bio, or existential crisis:
